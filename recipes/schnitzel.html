    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Although his ancestors have nothing to do with Bavaria, mr Ramsay really loves the schnitzel. The juicy yet crispy meat is something he often finds himself thinking about</p>
    <p>The first time he had it was around 8 years old. Right after his football game vs Bayern Munchen as a spare goalie, the head coach of the opposing team saw potential in him and asked him to join the team for dinner. The restaurant happened to specialize in schnitzels and that is when he fell in love with them.</p>
