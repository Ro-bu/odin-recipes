    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mr Ramsay thinks that nothing beats a hot soup ion a cold rainy day and I must agree with him. But doing the perfect soup is a tricky task.</p>
    <p>Although there are no official records on when Gordin had his first soup, people say it must of been around the age of 4. His father was a famous soupmaker in the 50's. Their old family house was destroyed by a wildfire with all of the family recipes, but we believe that Ramsays sophisticated pallette remembers all the details.</p>
